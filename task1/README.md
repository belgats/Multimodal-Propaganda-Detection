# Task 1: Persuasion Technique Detection


The aim of this task is to identify the propagandistic content from multigenre (tweet and news paragraphs of the news articles) text. Please see the [Task Description](#task-description) below.

## Task Description
Given a multigenre text snippet (a news paragraph or a tweet), the task is to detect the propaganda techniques used in the text together with the exact span(s) in which each propaganda technique appears. This a sequence tagging task.

## Dataset
All datasets are JSONL files where each line has one JSON object. The text encoding is UTF-8.
The input and the result files have the same format.

### Input data format
Each object has the following format:
```
{
  id -> identifier of the example,
  text -> text,
  labels -> the list of persuasion techniques appearing in the text and associated spans,
  type -> Type of sample: paragraph OR tweet
}
```
##### Example
```
    {
        "id": "1386222444575436801",
        "text": "مان سيتي وتوتنهام.. صراع على لقب كأس الرابطة الإنجليزية LINK LINK", 
        "labels": [
          {"start": 20, "end": 24, "technique": "Loaded_Language", "text": "صراع"}
          ], 
        "type": "tweet"
    }
```


## Scorer and Official Evaluation Metrics

### Scorers

The scorer is located in the [scorer](scorer) module of the project. The scorer will report official evaluation metric and other metrics of a prediction file. The scorer invokes the format checker for the task to verify the output is properly shaped.
<!-- It also handles checking if the provided predictions file contains all tweets from the gold one. -->


You can install all prerequisites through,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Launch the scorer as follows:
```
python scorer/task_1.py --gold-file-path=<path_gold_file> --pred-file-path=<predictions_file> --techniques_file_path ./techniques_list_task1.txt
```

##### Example

```
python scorer/task1.py --pred_files_path task1_dev_output.txt --gold_file_path data/araieval24_task1_dev.jsonl --techniques_file_path ./techniques_list_task1.txt
```

### Official Evaluation Metrics
The **official evaluation metric** for the task is a modified **micro-F1** measure that accounts for partial matching between the spans across the gold labels and the predictions.


## Baselines

##### Random baseline
```
python baselines/task1.py --dev_file_path data/araieval24_task1_dev.jsonl --output_file_path task1_dev_random_baseline.jsonl --techniques_file_path ./techniques_list_task1.txt
 ```
<!---If you submit the predictions of the baseline on the development set for 1A to the shared task website, you would get a micro-F1 score of 0.5405.--->

<!---If you submit the predictions of the baseline on the development set for 1B to the shared task website, you would get a micro-F1 score of 0.0938.--->


## Format checker

The format checker is located in the [format_checker](format_checker) module of the project. The format checker verifies that your generated results file complies with the expected format.

Before running the format checker please install all prerequisites through,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To launch it, please run the following command:

```
python format_checker/task1.py -p paths_to_your_results_files -c path_to_techniques
```

##### Example:
```
python format_checker/task1.py -p task1_dev_random_baseline.jsonl -c ./techniques_list_task1.txt
```

**paths_to_your_results_files**: can be one path or space seperated list of paths

**-c (path_to_techniques)**: specify the path of file with complete list of possible techniques.

**Note that the checker cannot verify whether the prediction file you submit contains all lines, because it does not have access to the corresponding gold file.**


## Submission

### Guidelines
The process consists of two phases:

1. **System Development Phase:** This phase involves working on the *dev set*.
2. **Final Evaluation Phase:** This phase involves working on the *test set*, which will be released during the ***evaluation cycle***.
For each phase, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Each team should create and maintain a single account for submissions. Please ensure all runs are submitted through this account. Submissions from multiple accounts by the same team could result in your system being not ranked in the overview paper.
- The **most recent** file submitted to the leaderboard will be considered your final submission.
- The output file must be named task1_suffix.jsonl (for example, task1_dev_team_name.jsonl). Failure to follow this naming convention will result in an error on the leaderboard.
- You are required to compress the .jsonl file into a .zip file (for example, zip task1_dev_team_name.zip task1_dev_team_name.jsonl) and submit it via the Codalab page.
- Please include your team name and a description of your method with each submission.
- You are permitted to submit a maximum of 200 submissions per day.
