# Task 1: Persuasion Technique Detection


The aim of this task is to identify the propagandistic content from multigenre (tweet and news paragraphs of the news articles) text. This year we offer two two subtasks. Please see the [Task Description](#task-description) below.

## Task Description

**Subtask 1A:** Given a multigenre (tweet and news paragraph) text snippet, identify whether it contains content with persuasion technique. This is a binary classification task.
  <!-- - **Subtask 1A-TWT:** Text snippet is a tweet. -->
  <!-- - **Subtask 1A-PAR:** Text snippet is a paragraph from news articles. -->

**Subtask 1B:** Given a multigenre (tweet and news paragraph) text snippet, identify the propaganda techniques used in it. This is a multilabel classification task.
  <!-- - **Subtask 1B-TWT:** Text snippet is a tweet. -->
  <!-- - **Subtask 1B-PAR:** Text snippet is a paragraph from news articles. -->

## Dataset
All datasets are JSONL files where each line has one JSON object. The text encoding is UTF-8.
The input and the result files have the same format for all the subtasks.

### Input data format

#### Subtask 1A:
Each object has the following format:
```
{
  id -> identifier of the example,
  text -> text,
  label -> the binary label,
}
```
##### Example
```
    {
        "id": "00030",
        "text": "قائد الجيش "خطّ أحمر" وواشنطن "راجعة"... LINK",
        "label": "true"
    }
```

#### Subtask 1B:
Each object has the following format:
```
{
  id -> identifier of the example,
  text -> text,
  labels -> the list of persuasion techniques appearing in the text,
}
```
##### Example
```
    {
        "id": "00030",
        "text": "قائد الجيش "خطّ أحمر" وواشنطن "راجعة"... LINK",
        "labels": ["Name_Calling-Labeling"]
    }
```


## Scorer and Official Evaluation Metrics

### Scorers

The scorer for the subtasks is located in the [scorer](scorer) module of the project. The scorer will report official evaluation metric and other metrics of a prediction file. The scorer invokes the format checker for the task to verify the output is properly shaped.
<!-- It also handles checking if the provided predictions file contains all tweets from the gold one. -->


You can install all prerequisites through,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Launch the scorer for the subtask as follows:
```
python scorer/subtask_1.py --gold-file-path=<path_gold_file> --pred-file-path=<predictions_file> --subtask=<name_of_the_subtask> --techniques_file_path ./techniques_list_task1.txt
```

`--subtask` expects options for subtasks (1A or 1B) to indicate the subtask for which to score the predictions file.

##### Example

```
python scorer/task1.py --pred_files_path task1B_dev_output.txt --gold_file_path data/task1B_dev.jsonl --subtask 1B --techniques_file_path ./techniques_list_task1.txt
```

### Official Evaluation Metrics
The **official evaluation metric** for the task is **micro-F1**. However, the scorer also reports macro-F1.


## Baselines
The same script can be used for both subtasks.

##### Random baseline
```
python baselines/task1.py --dev_file_path data/ArAiEval23_prop_subtask1B_dev.jsonl --output_file_path task1B.txt --subtask 1B --techniques_file_path ./techniques_list_task1.txt
 ```
If you submit the predictions of the baseline on the development set for 1A to the shared task website, you would get a micro-F1 score of 0.5405.

If you submit the predictions of the baseline on the development set for 1B to the shared task website, you would get a micro-F1 score of 0.0938.


## Format checker

The format checker for both subtsaks is located in the [format_checker](format_checker) module of the project. The format checker verifies that your generated results file complies with the expected format.

Before running the format checker please install all prerequisites through,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To launch it, please run the following command:

```
python format_checker/task1.py -p paths_to_your_results_files -c path_to_techniques_for_task_1B -s 1A/1B
```

##### Example:
```
python format_checker/task1.py -p task1B.txt -c ./techniques_list_task1.txt -s 1B
```

**paths_to_your_results_files**: can be one path or space seperated list of paths

**-c (path_to_techniques_for_task_1B)**: this argument is only needed for task 1B

**Note that the checker cannot verify whether the prediction file you submit contains all lines, because it does not have access to the corresponding gold file.**


## Submission

### Guidelines
The process consists of two phases:

1. **System Development Phase:** This phase involves working on the *dev set*.
2. **Final Evaluation Phase:** This phase involves working on the *test set*, which will be released during the ***evaluation cycle***.
For each phase, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Each team should create and maintain a single account for submissions. Please ensure all runs are submitted through this account. Submissions from multiple accounts by the same team could result in your system being not ranked in the overview paper.
- The most recent file submitted to the leaderboard will be considered your final submission.
- The output file must be named task1[A/B].tsv, where A/B is your specific subtask (for example, task1A_team_name.tsv). Failure to follow this naming convention will result in an error on the leaderboard.  Subtasks include 1A and 1B.
- You are required to compress the .tsv file into a .zip file (for example, zip subtask1B.zip subtask1B.tsv) and submit it via the Codalab page.
- Please include your team name and a description of your method with each submission.
- You are permitted to submit a maximum of 200 submissions per day for each subtask.

### Submission Site
**System Development Phase:** Please submit your results on the respective subtask tab: https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/14563

**Final Evaluation Phase:** Please submit your results on the respective subtask tab: https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/15099

## Licensing
The dataset is free for general research use.
